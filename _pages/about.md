I am Chenxi Liu (ÂàòÊô®Êõ¶), and you may also call me Dylan. Currently I am a Ph.D. Candidate of [STAR Lab](http://www.uwstarlab.org/) in Civil & Environmental Engineering at [University of Washington Seattle](https://www.ce.washington.edu/). In Autumn 2024, I will begin my role as an Assistant Professor in Civil and Environmental Engineering at [University of Utah](https://www.civil.utah.edu/). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.civil.tsinghua.edu.cn/ceen/) in 2017 and completed my Master's degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the [University of Washington](https://www.ce.washington.edu/) in 2020.

My research focused on the situation-aware customized machine intelligence to establish a connected and autonomous transportation system for safety, equity and resiliency. More specifically, I prefer to develop **advanced traffic sensing technologies** (traffic environment sensing, 3D object sensing, crowds sensing, cooperative sensing) with **distributed machine intelligence** (edge computing) to build a **connected and smart transportation system** for various applications (SPaT challenge, intersection safety, dilemma zone mitigation).

## Cyber-physical Cooperation

As deep learning technologies increasingly integrate into transportation systems, concerns are escalating regarding the system resilience and adaptability in the face of a range of uncertainties, including variable environmental factors, fluctuating traffic conditions, and irregular distributions of road users. The development of an adaptive and autonomous traffic system through cyber-physical cooperation promises a transformative approach to mitigating such uncertainties, ensuring more resilient, safer, and equitable transportation networks.

> The physical traffic environment, characterized by factors plays a crucial role in influencing the traffic system. Unfortunately, the neglect of these essential environmental aspects can lead to severe repercussions, especially under adverse weather conditions, including a decline in accuracy and the emergence of anomalies. To mitigate the uncertainties arising from the traffic environment, I have proposed an Edge-based Multi-task Safety-oriented Environmental (Edge-MuSE) sensing system. Edge-MuSE is designed to provide an extensive perception of the traffic environment, encompassing temperature, humidity, image dehazing, visibility measurement, and road surface condition classification. This innovative system is tailored for comprehensive, efficient, and cost-effective real-time monitoring, enhancing the reliability and safety of traffic management systems.



## Integrated Sensing Technologies

Many current traffic sensing systems often face significant challenges due to the limitations of isolated sensing mechanisms, leading to not only sensor saturation and data overload, but also results in a fragmented traffic conditions awareness. Cooperative sensing technologies offer a transformative solution by integrating data from multiple sources, both within sensor unit (intra-sensor) and among various entities (inter-sensor), to enable a comprehensive understanding of traffic scenarios that enhances decision-making and improves hazard awareness.

## Distributed Machine Intelligence for Smart and Connected Transportation Systems

Distributed Machine Intelligence stands as a critical innovation for transportation systems, offering decentralized, privacy preserving, and robust
processing capability that enhance safety and smart management across infrastructures
