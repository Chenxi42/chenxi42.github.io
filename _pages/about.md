# About Me

I am Chenxi Liu (ÂàòÊô®Êõ¶), and you may also call me Dylan. Currently I am a Ph.D. Candidate of [STAR Lab](http://www.uwstarlab.org/) in Civil & Environmental Engineering at [University of Washington Seattle](https://www.ce.washington.edu/). In Autumn 2024, I will begin my role as an Assistant Professor in Civil and Environmental Engineering at [University of Utah](https://www.civil.utah.edu/). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.civil.tsinghua.edu.cn/ceen/) in 2017 and completed my Master's degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the [University of Washington](https://www.ce.washington.edu/) in 2020.

My research focused on the situation-aware customized machine intelligence to establish a connected and autonomous transportation system for safety, equity and resiliency. More specifically, I prefer to develop **advanced traffic sensing technologies** (traffic environment sensing, 3D object sensing, crowds sensing, cooperative sensing) with **distributed machine intelligence** (edge computing) to build a **connected and smart transportation system** for various applications (SPaT challenge, intersection safety, dilemma zone mitigation).

# üöÄÔ∏èFunded Ph.D. Student Positions Are Opening!!!üöÄÔ∏è

I am pleased to offer fully funded Ph.D. positions starting in Autumn 2024 in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of Utah. Candidates will engage in cutting-edge research focused on **customizing machine intelligence within the field of intelligent transportation**. Key areas of research will include, but are not limited to:

* Integrated sensing technologies
* Cyber-physical coopertation
* Distributed computing
* Predictive control methods
* Smart Infrastructure
* Connected and autonmous transportation systems

If you are passionate about these research areas and enjoy living in Salt Lake City, which offers world-class skiing and numerous national parks, I would be delighted to consider you for our team. Please send your transcript and CV to [chenxiliu42@gmail.com](). Let's get together and have some fun!

Undergraduate/graudate visitors are also welcome.
